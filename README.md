# Finding Lanes on the road
### Overview
Human eyes help them to detect the lane lines and consequently help them to steer the vehicle. Similary, cameras and sensors act as eyes for a vehicle to drive autonomously. The first step in developing a autonomous driving car would be to detect lane lines automatically in images and videos using an algorithm which is implemented using python and openCV.Techniques of Canny edge detection and hough transform are used to detect lane lines on the road. 

### Project Files
This project contains two files: a file containing project code and a file containing a brief write up explaining the solution.
1. Jupyter Notebook: a IPython file containing project code.
2. Project report : contains brief write up explaining the solution and approach to it.
3. Environment.yml file : contains environment setup (packages/libraries) that we need for this project.
4. test_images and test_images_output : folders for taking images and saving test outputs respectively.
5. test_videos and test_videos_output : folders for taking videos and saving test outputs respectively

### Instruction for running the code:
- Install anaconda/miniconda or docker 
- Install jupyter notebooks
- Please run the environment.yml file so that all the packages and libraries required for this project are imported and environment is created
- Test on images in test_images and videos in test_videos folders.
- If you want to save the final output images please uncomment the plt.savefig() written in code.
